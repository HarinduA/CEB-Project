 Celone Electricity Board Bill Calculation for Domestic Users
This Python program calculates the monthly electricity bill for domestic users based on the units of electricity consumed. 
The calculation follows a tiered rate structure with different rates applied to specific ranges of units (S1, S2, S3, S4, and units above S4). 
The user inputs the total number of units consumed in a month, and the program computes the bill by applying the corresponding rates and fixed charges for each slab. 
The program also handles the consumption of units exceeding the maximum allowed in the lower slabs by charging a higher rate for the surplus units. 
The result is a total bill amount that incorporates both per-unit charges and fixed rates for each slab. This solution is tailored for users in areas with a similar electricity billing system to that of Celone Electricity Board.
